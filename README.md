# project-pollution
***
# This is a simple application that shows the pollution level of a certain city. Not all cities are present, because they do not have the station with the sensor or it is not in the database managed by the API
## In this project I used Axios to make API calls and also did a webpack configuration.
### Finally I upload the application to a free webhost, this is the link: https://project-pollution-71dcf.web.app/index.html
